<h1>Your Best</h1>
<p>If you always try your best <br>
Then you'll never have to wonder <br>
About what could have done <br>
If you'd summoned all your thunder. <br> <br>
And if your best <br>
Was not good <br>
As you hoped it would be, <br>
You still could say, <br>
"I gave today <br>
All that I had in me."</p>
