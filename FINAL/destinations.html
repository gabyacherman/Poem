          <h2>Maine</h2>
          <p>
            Packing for Maine is sort of like packing for an adventure: You'll
            want to bring your sturdiest boots and most weather-resistant
            jacket, and the kind of bag that has room for fresh blueberries.
            Scenic Maine is known for its relaxed New England lifestyle, not so
            much the mansions of Greenwich or Newport as the earthy, sea-dashed
            homes that look like they've got stories. Bring your flannel, your
            favorite Stephen King novel (for the full experience of Maine's most
            famous resident, of course), and a taste for lobster, and you'll be
            ready for anything.

          <p>
            From the vastness of the Grand Canyon to Sedona's red rocks and the
            living Sonoran Desert, Arizona's landscapes are awe-inspiring. The
            state's spectacular canyons, blooming deserts, raging rivers,
            petrified forests, and scenic mountains enthrall lovers of the
            outdoors in pursuit of hiking, rafting, golf, or picturesque spots
            to watch the sunset. But there is more to Arizona than beautiful
            vistas. World-renowned spas in Phoenix provide plenty of pampering,
            while Native American cultures thrive throughout the state.

            Bordered to the south by the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana is a mix of
            swampland and farm country as well as a melting pot of French,
            African and American cultures. Its capital, Baton Rouge, is home to
            the USS Kidd Navy destroyer, while its largest city, New Orleans, is
            famous for its colonial-era French Quarter and festive Mardi Gras, a
            raucous, city-wide party celebrated with a colorful parades, loud
            music and outlandish floats. Louisianans share an appreciation for
            the good things in life as well as an outspoken enthusiasm for their
            state’s Creole heritage.

          <p>
            Whether you’re seeking the bustle of historic Boston, trendy
            Martha’s Vineyard or the pastoral tranquility of the Berkshires,
            Massachusetts travel offers something for everyone. Though small in
            size, Massachusetts is big on diversity, and travelers delight in a
            multifaceted vacation experience. Travel to Massachusetts where
            history buffs can relive events like The Boston Tea Party, Paul
            Revere’s Ride, or The Salem Witch Trials. Beach lovers will revel in
            the sands of Cape Cod and the islands of the Eastern Coastline and
            Nantucket. Antique lovers can happily hunt for treasures in both
            rural and urban antique shops. For the history buff, a trip to
            Boston is like traveling back in time. For the bird-watcher, the
            Berkshires are the ultimate spot to dust off the binoculars. And for
            the person just hoping to relax, Nantucket offers a refuge unlike
            any other.

          <h2>Texas</h2>
          <p>
            Texas is one of the largest states in America - second only to
            Alaska. The nickname “The Lone Star State” is a reference to Texas’
            days as an independent republic and to the days when the state
            struggled to free itself from Mexico. Those who visit Texas will
            find a state packed with a variety of landscapes. From the desert in
            West Texas to the Piney Woods in East Texas, those who travel to
            Texas will find that it is sure to impress.

            Boasting 12 national parks, Utah makes for a wild playground for the
            adventurous outdoorsman. From red rock canyons and sandstone desert
            in the South, to the snow-capped Wasatch mountain peaks in the
            North, the diverse scenery of this western state will stun even the
            most seasoned traveler. Formerly a conservative Mormon territory,
            the state and in particular, Salk Lake City and Park City, have
            developed into progressive towns with bustling nightlife and
            enticing food scenes. Visit Utah to experience its dramatic
            landscape and unique culture and history.

          <h2>Alaska</h2>
          <p>
            Alaska lands on so many travelers' bucket lists because even though
            it's part of the United States, it feels like a world apart. Indeed,
            the 49th state still has a lot of seemingly untouched frontier to
            explore. Whether you visit Alaska as part of a cruise, or rent an RV
            to take on the ultimate road trip, there are many experiences here
            that you just can't find anywhere else. The Alaskan Native
            communities that still live here add vivid culture to the landscape,
            while wildlife - the "big five" of bears, wolves, Dall sheep,
            caribou and moose - thrive in Denali National Park, as well as all
            over the state - you can even see the occasional moose loping down
            the street in Alaska's biggest city, Anchorage.

            From snowcapped volcanoes to rainforests to lava-rock deserts,
            Hawaii is much more than the parade of high-rise hotels that hug
            glorious Waikiki Beach. The push and pull between highly developed
            tourist apex, ancient Polynesian culture, and natural paradise is
            palpable in the complex 50th state. It is where everywhere the
            generous spirit of “aloha” is infectious, making lifetime repeat
            visitors of many who set foot on these exotic, yet very American,
            islands.

          <p>
            Besides the urban allure, culture, and shopping of Manhattan, much
            of New York State is still, in many ways, waiting to be discovered
            on a grand scale. The state is endowed with outstanding beauty and
            diversity of scenery from one end to the other. The historic Hudson
            Valley, a majestic river lined with elegant estates, is finally
            positioning itself as a destination, not just a day trip from the
            city. The great wilderness of the Adirondack and Catskill mountains
            is magnificent for outdoors and sporting vacations, but those spots
            are also home to the easygoing charms of small towns. The pristine
            glacial-lake beauty and outstanding wineries of the Finger Lakes
            make it one of the state's most spectacular, yet lesser-known
            destinations.

            nightlife, the glitz of Palm Beach, or the quiet expanse of the
            Everglades, almost all visitors find something to love here. From
            the powdery white beaches of the Panhandle to the vibrant coral
            reefs of the Florida Keys, the ocean is always calling—for sailing,
            fishing, diving, swimming, and other water sports. Stray off the
            path a few miles, and you might glimpse a bit of the Florida of old,
            including cigar makers and mermaids.

            home of the Rocky Mountains’ highest peaks. From the youthful and
            cosmopolitan feel of downtown Denver to the natural splendor of the
            Rockies and its surrounding ski resorts to the sparsely populated
            prairie lands with their picturesque buttes and canyons, a visit to
            Colorado offers an opportunity to marvel at a diverse natural
            landscape, without sacrificing urban comforts entirely.

          <h2>Wyoming</h2>
          <p>
            While the days of the Wild West seem like history to many of us,
            Wyoming is still a land of cowboys and ranches. Even in high-end
            Jackson Hole, western attire mixes with ski gear. True to that
            frontier spirit, it's a land perfect for exploration. The world's
            oldest national park, Yellowstone, brings scores of visitors to the
            state every year for the geothermal features and abundant wildlife.
            But don't miss out on the Grand Tetons, atmospheric towns like Cody
            and Jackson, and vast stretches of wide-open plains.
