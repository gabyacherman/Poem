    <h1>Maine</h1>
    <p>Packing for Maine is sort of like packing for an adventure: You'll want to bring your sturdiest boots and most weather-resistant jacket, and the kind of bag that has room for fresh blueberries. Scenic Maine is known for its relaxed New England lifestyle, not so much the mansions of Greenwich or Newport as the earthy, sea-dashed homes that look like they've got stories. Bring your flannel, your favorite Stephen King novel (for the full experience of Maine's most famous resident, of course), and a taste for lobster, and you'll be ready for anything. <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-guide/maine">Learn more</a></p>

    <h1>Hawaii</h1>

    <h1>New York</h1>
